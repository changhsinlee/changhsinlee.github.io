In the last two years, I've learned a lot of about how to develop code efficiently. 

I think knowing how to do these things is a good start to becoming efficient in development, so I put them into a checklist. It is borrowed heavily from how people do things in software development and I used most of them daily in my workflow.

## The checklist

#### Git

- [ ] I know how to create a new branch when developing a new feature.
- [ ] I know how to merge branches and resolve merge conflicts.
- [ ] I know how to discard or fix bad commits.
- [ ] I know how to squash commit messages to prevent clutter.
- [ ] I know how to ignore data in my project.

#### Projects

- I know how to use my IDE or text editor efficiently
    - [ ] I know how to look up a function or a class.
    - [ ] I know how to rename a method or a class for all occurences.
    - [ ] I know how to move a function or class to a different file.
    - [ ] I know how to use a linter and set up style guides.
<br>
- [] I know how to pin down project dependency for development.
- [] I know how to create the development environment with dependencies for a project 
- [] I know how to package my code for distribution.

#### Testing

- [ ] I know how to run tests for existing projects.
- [ ] I know how to use a testing framework.
- [ ] I know how to write a test to complete a bugfix and prevent the bug from happening again.

#### Misc

- [ ] I know how to use a profiler to look for bottlenecks.
